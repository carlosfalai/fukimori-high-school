# 🎮 Fukimori High School - Quick Start Guide

## Your Game is LIVE and Working!

### 🚀 Immediate Access (Current Session)

**Your backend is currently running and publicly accessible!**

1. **Game URL**: https://fukimori-high-school.netlify.app
2. **Backend Tunnel**: https://bitter-waves-flash.loca.lt (temporary, active now)

The game should be working RIGHT NOW! Just visit the Netlify URL above.

### 📱 What's Working:

✅ **Character Consistency System** - NPCs remember everything
✅ **Achievement System** - "Not a Simp Anymore", "Enemy of the School" etc.
✅ **Real Japanese Calendar** - Currently summer break (August 15, 2025)
✅ **Dynamic Reputation** - Your actions affect how everyone treats you
✅ **Music Integration** - Spotify playlists for each location
✅ **Multiplayer Ready** - Framework for real player interactions

### 🎯 Test the Features:

1. **Create a character** - You'll be a male student at Fukimori High
2. **Talk to NPCs** - They remember past conversations
3. **Earn achievements** - Try flirting to unlock "Not a Simp Anymore"
4. **Check reputation** - Your title changes based on actions
5. **Explore locations** - Different music and characters in each area

### ⚠️ Important Notes:

- The backend tunnel (bitter-waves-flash.loca.lt) is **temporary**
- It will work as long as your terminal session is open
- All players are male students (authentic all-boys school setting)
- Female characters are NPCs only

### 🔧 If the Game Stops Working:

The tunnel might have disconnected. To restart:

```bash
# In terminal 1: Start backend
cd server
npm run dev

# In terminal 2: Create new tunnel
npx localtunnel --port 3001
# This will give you a new URL like: https://xxxxx.loca.lt
```

Then update the frontend to use the new URL by visiting the game and it should reconnect.

### 🏆 Achievement Examples to Try:

- **"Not a Simp Anymore"** - Successfully kiss someone
- **"Enemy of the School"** - Date the most popular girl
- **"Professional Friend"** - Get friendzoned multiple times
- **"Lunch Alone Champion"** - Eat alone for 2 weeks
- **"The School's TMZ"** - Spread successful rumors

### 💡 Pro Tips:

- Your reputation affects EVERYTHING - NPCs react differently based on your stats
- Achievements can make you famous or infamous
- Some actions cost more "energy points" than others
- The game follows real Japanese school calendar and holidays
